## Hi there 👋

🤝 Currently working as a security consultant providing mutual aid.
📚 Formerly a hacktivist and community educator, but slowly returning.
🌱 Pursuing an AS in cybersecurity along with several certifications.
🗨️ Always willing to talk about information security and hacktivism.
🌈 Hoping to branch out my skillset in education as much as I can.

Eventually, I'll add more here ⭐
